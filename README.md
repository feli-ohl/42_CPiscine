# 42 C Piscine Projects

This repository contains all the projects I completed during the C Piscine at 42. It includes a variety of exercises and mini-projects focused on developing a strong foundation in C programming.

Most of the projects are written in C, covering topics such as memory management, pointers, functions, and basic algorithms. There are also a few Bash scripts related to Linux command-line tasks.

The repository reflects my learning journey and growth during the Piscine, and it's intended to showcase my problem-solving skills and coding style in low-level programming.
